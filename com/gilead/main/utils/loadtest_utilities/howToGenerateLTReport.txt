This document is just a quick procedure to show others on how to generate LoadTesting Report.
Currently, the report template supports 5 apps and 5 loops each.

Steps:
1. Set the LOOPING value in definition.py to number of loops <=5.
2. Run test W10DA_153.
3. Get DetailTestLog.txt from ..\com\gilead\test\logs to local working directory.
4. Run pre-processing executing initial parsing:
	python parseDetailedReport.py which will produce LOADTEST.txt
5. Use LOADTEST.txt as input to generateLoadTestReportFromTemplate.py.
   This script will parse the LOADTEST.txt and update a jinga2 template, and output 
   it to Load-Testing_Summary_Report.html.
ie: python generateLoadTestReportFromTemplate.py

6. Then open up the file: Load-Testing_Summary_Report.html using a browser to view the report.

NOTE: Its best to execute all these steps in Command Line Terminal.
End results can be viewed in browser.
